# Steam Bulk Card Buyer
## BETA

This Chrome extension adds a button to your Steam badge pages allowing you to buy all the cards you need to finish a badge from the Steam Market at once.

Get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steam-trading-cards-bulk/ahlhfglcnmjjncfolgbdnohcgddgpjji?hl=en&gl=US).

This is in beta, so don't expect it to work flawlessly all of the time. Only works with USD for now.
